## Reactive vs asyncronous programming
- Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams. This technique works with data that is consistently streamed and needs to be handled.

## Observer pattern for RxJS
- Observer - Subscriber pattern
- Observer listens to data change events
- Subscriber who actually does things & reacts to those data change events
- An observer may have one or many subscribers & each subscriber can react differently to an observer's data change event.
- RxJS was designed as a framework for this pattern.
